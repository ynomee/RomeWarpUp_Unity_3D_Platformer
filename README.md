# RomeWapm Up_Unity_3D_platformer
The game is a 3D first-person platformer where the main goal is to complete the level as quickly as possible by utilizing the environment to your advantage. Players must leap across gaps, balance on narrow platforms, and strategically use and mechanisms to gain an edge.

But thatâ€™s not all: a fiery wall relentlessly chases the player, destroying everything in its path, while molten lava waits below. Every mistake could be your last, so quick reflexes, precise jumps, and smart planning are essential to survive and set a new record!
